I am a postdoc researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology since November 2015. I received my B.Sc. in software engineering from Arak University (Iran) in 2009. I obtained my M.Sc. and Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from Mälardalen University, Sweden in 2011 and 2015 respectively.
I have been a visiting researcher at McGill University, Montreal, Canada for five months in 2013 and 2014. I am a member of the ForSyDe group at the School for Information and Communication Technology.

My research interests are reservation-based real-time scheduling, feedback scheduling and design space exploration using constraint programming and evolutionary metaheuristics.
